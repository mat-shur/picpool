🚀🚀🚀 Welcome to picpool — the PumpFun-like NFT protocol!

🎯 Create a new NFT listing with a start and end price.
🧮 Set total supply and (optionally) premint up to 10 NFTs for yourself.
📈 Price automatically goes up with each buy, and drops with burns.
💥 No orders. No offers. Just pure market action via the liquidity pool.
🛡️ Revenue is locked until all NFTs are minted. The dev can’t touch funds unless the collection is fully minted. No early rug pulls here. 😎
🧠 It’s like Pump.Fun — but for NFTs, and with a built-in anti-rug mechanism.
